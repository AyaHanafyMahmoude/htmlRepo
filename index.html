                    But when his ship is ordered to destroy the vegetation and return, Lowell mutinies and continues to
                    tend his foliage with the help of three memorable robo-assistants. It's by turns dramatic, quiet,
                    and reflective, an environmental warning that refrains from throwing its message in your face.</h3>

                <h3>If its premise sounds like a lost Michael Bay movie – criminals on a spaceship are hurtling into a
                    black hole! – Claire Denis' meditative science fiction movie is anything but, more in keeping with
                    the sharp-edged existentialist sci-fi of the 1970s. Robert Pattinson's Monte is one of a group of
                    prisoners who are effectively used as experimental subjects by Juliette Binoche's scientist. Dark,
                    moody and occasionally very violent, it's a psychological trip into the void, drenched in palpable
                    dread, with unsettling eroticism, nightmarish abstract imagery, and excellent, thoughtful
                    performances, particularly the ever-great Pattinson. Deep, dark, grown-up sci-fi that eschews outer
                    space action for intellectual and emotional challenge.</h3>

                <h3>
                    Bong Joon Ho's high-concept satire finally has the wide UK release it long deserved. Based on French
                    post-apocalyptic graphic novel Le Transperceneige, Snowpiercer's unique futuristic satire finds the
                    remnants of humanity crammed onto a train hurtling around the surface of a deep-frozen Earth, its
                    carriages containing a stratified society of haves and have-nots. Chris Evans is Curtis, one of the
                    poor schlubs in the tail section, ready to overthrow the system and fight back against the likes of
                    Tilda Swinton's outrageous Thatcher-alike Mason. As ever with Director Bong's work, it's a real
                    genre mash-up, with great action sequences and an idiosyncratic wit – but in addressing real-world
                    class issues through a fanciful not-so-far-future vision, it's the Korean auteur at his most sci-fi.
                    Just don't expect it to show up in a Mother And Baby screening any time soon.

                <h3>Most sci-fi films look to the cosmos for signs of new life. Trust James Cameron, then – long before
                    Avatar – to look to the other inky-black instead, the mysterious ocean depths. With its sub-aquatic
                    entities (rendered with then-cutting-edge VFX that still looks good today) and a Jules Verne-ian
                    sense of deep-sea exploration, The Abyss feels distinct from the usual space-bound sci-fi. At the
                    heart of it is a team of expert divers who are hired to look for a missing nuclear submarine and
                    find something much more fascinating. Cameron's love of diving and his environmental side are on
                    full display here, laying the groundwork for much of what he's gone on to since – from the
                    waterworks of Titanic, to Avatar's bioluminescent planet, and the long-promised oceans of Pandora in
                    the upcoming Avatar sequels. It didn't have the box office impact of Cameron's big-hitters, but it's
                    still worth submerging yourself into.</h3>

                <h3>Proving that ideas-driven sci-fi could thrive without a blockbuster budget, Richard Kelly's
                    distinctive indie debut plays with time and malleable reality as he puts Jake Gyllenhaal's depressed
                    high schooler through the wringer. With its time-looping narrative, suburban wormhole, and
                    apocalyptic visions of a glowy-eyed bunny-man, Kelly fuses none-more-sci-fi elements into a low-key
                    character drama, with head-scratching talking points and a killer soundtrack that made it a total
                    cult hit. Trippy, atmospheric, and boasting the impressive screen arrival of Gyllenhaal, Donnie
                    Darko leaves you wanting more – just, don't go tracking down the odd non-Kelly sequel, S. Darko.

                <h3>Team Pixar was already on a golden streak, and then Wall-E arrived – the brainchild of veteran
                    creative type Andrew Stanton, a futuristic satire about how we treat the planet and each other, but,
                    you know, for kids. It was a risk that paid off beautifully, beginning as a near-silent film on the
                    bleak, trash-filled remains of Earth before blasting into an intergalactic adventure to save the
                    last remaining piece of viable plant life. Wall-E's stark opening astonishes, and it doesn't pull
                    its punches when it comes to dire eco-warnings, and skewering humanity's recklessly consumptive
                    consumerist ways. Wall-E's story goes straight for the heartstrings too with a swooning
                    robo-romance, musical sequences and a still-pertinent message for all of us, delivered in digestible
                    form.></h3>
